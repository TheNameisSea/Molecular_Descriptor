A data science app made in Python. Usage: Calculate the molecular descriptor and predict the molecular structure of the molecule from it formula (written in the SMILES format) 

Library:
* Streamlit: GUI
* Rdkit: Chemicals' properties calculation
* Numpy: Sciencetific calculation and array
* Pandas: Dataframe
* stmol, py3dmol, matplotlib: 3d model of molecules
